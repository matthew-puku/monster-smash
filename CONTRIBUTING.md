# Sooo you want to make your own "Monster Smash" ...

Just a few things about contributing or using our code for your projects ...

* "Monster Smash" codebase was developed as for **education purposes** only. 
  As such, it has been submitted to the public domain for comment and review by the open source development community (Github). 

* As such, the developers do not derive any revenue or royalties from the codebase. 

* The developers do not charge users a purchase or licensing fee for modifying or redistributing the source code. And users and contributors are explicitly prohibited from commercial distribution of all or any part, derivative of the codebase. 

* Forks or clones of our code repository are free to be re-distributed with mention of **(C) 2019 Matthew Puku, Rachel Wong**.   
  This means that the codebase created by us can be integrated into work that is under a more restrictive license, even those that are not considered open source licenses.

* Again, this is open source software. When you fork or clone the project, consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.

### Did you find a bug? 

Unforunately the application has reached end-of-life upon release. The developers do not offer any future support or further upgrades. 

### Can we adapt/roll our own game with your code?

Feel free to fork and clone our project. But we will not respond to any pull requests, we simply do not have the resources.

### Do you have questions about the source code?

Unfortunately the developers have to move onto other projects and will not be available your questions. We will be excited to see what projects that you create from our codebase.
