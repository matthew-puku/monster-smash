## Monsters Smash Readme.md

# Description
A collaboration between Matthew Puku and Rachel Wong, ‘Monsters Smash’ is a Ruby text adventure application built to explore principles of DRY scripting, modularisation, encapsulation, and object-oriented programming. This terminal application follows the common mechanics of popular turn-based games where users play against the computer by text-selecting a choice of “moves”. To win the game, the user must be the first to deplete the opponent’s (program) health score (HP). 

# Features and Functionality
This is a single-player game where the user select “moves” via text-input in a series of turns against the computer. Both the user and computer start the game with maximum full health score (HP). And each selected ‘move’ by the user and the computer is calculated to deplete the opponent’s health score by a specific value. A series of checking gateways (control structures) have been built in to continually check the health score (HP) of the user and computer. The end goal for the user is to deplete the computer’s health score before his or her health score is exhausted. 

Users can only interact with this terminal application via keyboard input.

# Build Status
The current product is a completed, functional proof-of-concept, with many extensible features identified by the team for future exploration.
